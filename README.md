Attempt to simulate a rolling shutter using POV-Ray.

"Smarter Every Day" examined the behaviour of mobile phone cameras when filming
a fast-moving object. Destin's explanation of the phenomenon is far better than
I can attempt to replicate, so go watch [his video](http://youtu.be/dNVtMmLlnoE)
and come back here afterwards :)

Destin simulated the effect using footage from a high speed camera. But what if
we could simulate the camera too? Hence, POV-Ray.
